- type: dataset
  name: ToyMix
  organization: Mila - Quebec AI Institute
  description: ToyMix is the smallest dataset of three extensive and meticulously
    curated multi-label datasets that cover nearly 100 million molecules and over
    3000 sparsely defined tasks.
  created_date: 2023-10-09
  url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04292.pdf
  datasheet: none
  modality: molecules, tasks
  size: 13B labels of quantum and biological nature.
  sample: []
  analysis: Models of size 150k parameters trained on ToyMix and compared to models
    trained on its dependencies across GNN baselines.
  dependencies: [QM9, TOX21, ZINC12K]
  included: ''
  excluded: ''
  quality_control: ''
  access: open
  license: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
  intended_uses: The datasets are intended to be used in an academic setting for
    training molecular GNNs with orders of magnitude more parameters than current
    large models. Further, the ToyMix dataset is intended to be used in a multi-task
    setting, meaning that a single model should be trained to predict them simultaneously.
