  name: Genstruct
  organization: Nous
  description: Genstruct is an instruction-generation model, designed to create valid instructions given a raw text corpus. This enables the creation of new, partially synthetic instruction finetuning datasets from any raw-text corpus. This work was inspired by Ada-Instruct and the model is also trained to generate questions involving complex scenarios that require detailed reasoning.
