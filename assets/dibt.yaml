  intended_uses: Training and evaluating language models on prompt ranking tasks
    and as a dataset that can be filtered only to include high-quality prompts.
    These can serve as seed data for generating synthetic prompts and generations.
  prohibited_uses: This dataset only contains rankings for prompts, not prompt/response
    pairs so it is not suitable for direct use for supervised fine-tuning of language
    models.
