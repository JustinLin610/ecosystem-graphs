  name: SDXL-Lightning
  organization: ByteDance
  description: SDXL-Lightning is a lightning-fast text-to-image generation model. It can generate high-quality 1024px images in a few steps. The models are distilled from stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0. This repository contains checkpoints for 1-step, 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step distilled models.
